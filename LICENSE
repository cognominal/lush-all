The Artistic License 2.0

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package
may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is
that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the
development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open
source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license
directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this
license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package,
you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing
arrangement.

Definitions

"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the
copyright notice for the entire Package.

"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to
the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
modify the Package.

"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may
consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.

"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to
anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of
your company or organization.

"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not
mean licensing fees.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration
files for the Package.

"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any
other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the
Source form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified
Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not
Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard
Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or
for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original
copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such copies
may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications
made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be
considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original
License.

Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a
Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version)
provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version,
including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables,
or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

  (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
      Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
      Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.

  (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
      user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
      Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of
      the Standard Version.

  (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
      Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
      the Original License, for a Distributor Fee not to exceed your cost
      of physically performing this distribution, and provided that you
      also make them aware that the Modified Version is available under
      the Original License.

(5) You may Distribute the Standard Version of the Package in Compiled form in
any medium without restriction, provided that you include complete
instructions for installing the Standard Version of the Package from the
Source form, and provided that you provide or make available the Source form
(which must be distributed under the terms of the Original License) in
at least one of the following ways:

  (a) alongside the Compiled form of the Package.

  (b) in or with the documentation for the Compiled form of the Package.

  (c) on a public server, or similar public area, where the Source form of the
      Standard Version may be downloaded without charge.

Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Compiled

(6) You may Distribute your Modified Version in Compiled form without
restriction, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

  (a) distribute the Compiled form of the Modified Version under the terms
      of the Original License.

  (b) include complete instructions for installing the Modified Version of the
      Package from the Source form and require that the installer also
      installs the Standard Version.

  (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
      Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
      the Original License, for a Distributor Fee not to exceed your cost
      of physically performing this distribution, and provided that you
      also make them aware that the Modified Version is available under
      the Original License.

Aggregating or Linking the Package

(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation
provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor
Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other software in the aggregation
are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of
the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works,
to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone
applications that include the Package, and Distribute the resulting work
without restriction, provided the terms of this license apply to the
Package.

(9) You may Distribute the Standard Version of the Package with or without
modifications, provided that if you use the Standard Version to create a
larger work, you do not prevent that larger work from being distributed under
this license.
