We want to unparse an augmented acorn tree (AAT) generated by svelte
in a susie representation based on a SusyNode tree.
We don't care yet about rerendering in AAT an edited ITT.
Note that the ITT reorder the ATT attributes and its own node
for attributes of name `id` and class.

We will design incrementally.
We want to eventually drive the unparsing with a set of rules
using yaml.

For now we leave the js/ts part alone and focus on html  that
is stuff under tne nodes of type Fragment.

if a leste susy has many node at the same level.

{ "anchored": !local &A1 "value",
  "alias": *A1 }

```html
<h1 t="u" id="ud" class="class1 class2">Hello!</>

```

```leste
h1 #id .class1 .class2 t=u Hello

```

We want to represent the resulting tree as yaml

   IT:
     kind-type: leste.tag
     subTokens:
     ast:
        type: RegularElement
