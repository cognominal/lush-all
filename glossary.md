# glossary

This file will be used to do popup on terms of markdown file views, possibly
linking to the markdown file  that discuss at length a given term.
Maybe it will use the reveal feature of html (name of element?).
Writing this glossary will permit to stabilize the vocabulary used.
The glossary probably does not make mush sense by itself but helps navigate more
elaborate definitions or jog the learner memory.

- susy: a `susy` is a lean, user configurable editable representation
  of a program. It is also the conventions and concrete rules that implement such
  conventions to obtain such a representation.
- source code: in lush, the source code has a reference representation called
  astre and one edited by the user the susy.
- huffing : huffmanization of huffmanization.
- huffmanization: shorter for  Reference to the Huffman algorithm that uses
  shorter encoding for often used tokens to decrease the length of a message.

- posh: adj: a `posh susy` is a susy  that uses font style as syntax. Typically
  the poshing of a token kind gives a clue to its kind.
   For example variable, versus keyword.
- vanilla: a `vanilla susy` is the standard representation of a language.
- astre: augmented syntax tree as reference representation. An astre can combine
  and augment standard AST convention
- aïd: unique id in an astre. aïds come in various use, with a prefix
  letter to identify its kind.
- saïd: unique id for a symbol.
- taïd: unique id for a node
- vaïds: variant taïd, as an astre node is modified or cloned, it get its own aïd.
- païd: parent taïd.
- uid: unique id that allow to create reference to independantly created
  entities. aïds are uids.
- anyq: a poshed augmentation of jq to manipulate various structured data,
  including shiva one.
- leste: a posh susy for svelte and its associated astre.
- lush: a ecosystem based on the interplay of astres and susys mediated by a lushed
- lish: the lush shell. Being terminal based it does not support web features
  unlike an lbook.
- lbook: a jupyter-like notebook based on lush.
- lushed: stands for lush editor, an editor capable to edit poshed susys and stavid
  them as astres.
- lyaml: yaml extended to support shiva or, as a posh, poshed variables,
  that are either interpolated or matched. Depending on use.
- grit: an augmented git that support astres.
- clit: collaborative literacy. Aïds makes maximally stable references
  to code despite code changes thanks to the aïds of astres.
- indexing, posh syntax to access parts of a map or an ary.
  For literal map indexer, posh  allow
  to distinguish it from parenthesis-less method call. In practice a adapter
  to appropriate underlying method calls.
- svelte:  reactive component-based front-end software framework. As a parsed
  language, it is an augmentation of acorn
- shiva: an object that has both the array and the map nature. A shiva tree : a
  tree made of such objects.
