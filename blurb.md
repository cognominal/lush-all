# Aspirational Blurb

Fulfilling Larry Wall's aspiration of meshing language and evolving them.
From nushell and jq, and using coroutines, it supports typed pipes of
infinite steams.
With an adapted YAML, to interpolate or match
Using styled forts as syntax as a vector of better expressivity,
the ecosystem had to thought with the language.

Lush as many avatars or modes, lish as a unix shell, leste
as leaner svelte

Lush is an AST-first, projectional language system centered on a canonical
model called Astre.  A Program susy is  edited with a suzyed like lushed.  A
susy is a styled surface syntax that uses indentation and font style as
primary channels, while relegating color and emphasis to secondary channels.

TBD: The lushed editor maintains a continuous, lossless correspondence between Susy
and Astre, ensuring that the program is always structurally valid. Stable node
identities (naïds) and symbol identities (saïds) enable reliable structural
diffing, lineage tracking via païds, and robust refactoring semantics.

Lush targets rich GUI environments (e.g., Monaco (TBD), CodeMirror (in
progress)) as the primary host for Susy.  But we constrain it (only styled
monospace fonts) so that TUI/terminal environments would not be degraded
projections due to their limited channel budget. Code generation proceeds by
generating a target Acorn AST from Astre, contrasting with pipelines such as
Svelte that lack persistent identity.

Lush as a language, support typed pipe (a la jq or nushell) and uses coroutine
so streams of indefinite length can be supported.

Deliverable:

- nuLush  : A sveltekit supporting lushed
- tauLush : same but as an app runnning in tauri
