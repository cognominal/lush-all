# TBD

## Session `26-02-12-12:52` (Default Dark Modern theme)

### Left To Do

- [ ] Refine `default-dark-modern.yaml` token mapping after visual
  side-by-side comparison against the Svelte eponymous VS Code theme.
- [ ] Decide whether to extend theme syntax for exact colors (hex/RGB) to
  improve parity with VS Code themes.
- [ ] If syntax is extended, update docs in `docs/highlighting-themes.md`
  with the new supported format and examples.
